# artifacts-helper.fish

This is meant to be used with the [Azure Artifacts Credential Helper](https://github.com/microsoft/codespace-features/tree/main/src/artifacts-helper) for Codespaces.

[Azure Artifacts Credential Helper](https://github.com/microsoft/codespace-features/tree/main/src/artifacts-helper) sets up "shadow functions" for bash and zsh, but not for fish. This adds wrappers around the Credential Helper scripts to be called from fish.

## Installation

Install with [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher):

```fish
fisher install scaryrawr/artifacts-helper.fish
```
